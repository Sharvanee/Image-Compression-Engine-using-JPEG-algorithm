# Image Compression Project

## Part A: Image Compression Engine using the JPEG Algorithm

### Grayscale Image Compression
The file **`jpeg_grayscale.ipynb`** contains an implementation of the JPEG compression algorithm for grayscale images.

### Colour Image Compression
The file **`jpeg_colour.ipynb`** includes an implementation of the JPEG compression algorithm for colour images.
